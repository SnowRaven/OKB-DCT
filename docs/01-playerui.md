# Players

This section describes the custom UI players can interact with.

## F10 Menus

Players interact with the theater through the "F10. Other" radio menu.

### Scratchpad Menu

The player scratchpad allows a player to input arbitrary data into the game.
This allows for things like submitting intel reports, joining another person's
mission, etc.

	F1. Scratch Pad
		F1. DISPLAY
		F2. SET
		F3. RUN


#### DISPLAY

Displays the contents of the current value of the scratch pad.

#### SET

Sets the value of the scratch pad by putting a mark on the map. The mark
will be placed at the current position of the player's aircraft. It is then
expected the player will edit this mark in the F10 map, the text script
put in the body of this map marker will become the new value of the scratch
pad.

**Note:** The moment focus is changed from this mark the scratch pad value will
be stored and the mark deleted from the map. Thus one cannot expect to go
in and out of the F10 map to edit the mark.

#### RUN

Run a generic text based command from the user.

### Intel Menu

	F2. Intel Maps
		F1. Strategic
		F2. Air Defense
		F3. Display Target
		F4. Clear All


These options display various intel on the F10 map via DCS mark points.
The maps are intended to provide the following:

 1. use the mark system to provide a visual intel report at both the
    strategic region and air defense levels
 2. do not force the visuals on players, have them request to see it
 3. Allow the marks to be deleted by the players

#### Strategic

Displays per-region strategic threat information, the categories are:

 * _AIR_ - any historical or current air threats in the region
 * _SAM_ - any **S**urface to **A**ir **M**issile systems in the region and
           types
 * _SHORAD_ - any short range or low level air defense in the region
 * _SEA_ - any sea threats known to be in the region

Example map mark report:

	Title: Region <name> Threat Report
	Body:
		AIR: Low
		SAM: High; 2 x SA-6, 1 x SA-10
		SHORAD: Medium
		SEA: None


#### Air Defense

Display SAM threats (not SHORAD) with marks representing their approximate
location based on the intel level currently known about the SAM.

Example map mark report:

	Title: SAM SA-6
	Body: empty


#### Display Target

Creates a mark point displaying the location of the assigned target location.

Example map mark report:

	Title: Target <callsign>
	Body:

		Threat Report:
			AIR: Low
			SAM: High; 2 x SA-6, 1 x SA-10
			SHORAD: Medium

		Weather:
			METAR: <time> <wind> <clouds> <temps> <altimiter>
